				<p>The following section profiles the people of Greenfield, detailing characteristics such as income, employment, household structure, and cost burden. These indicators combine to describe the local population's housing needs and preferences which inform this report's recommended strategies for new housing production to meet demand and fill gaps in affordability and attainability.</p>
				<h3>Greenfield's population is growing older.</h3>
				<p>Greenfield’s population has been rapidly aging over the past decade, with the 65+ age group growing while other age groups shrink. If these trends continue through the next decade, about a third of the population will be over 65+ with fewer adults at ages associated with starting and raising families. In general, younger households are more likely to prefer family-oriented housing and neighborhoods where as older households may have a broader range of preferences and priorities, including senior options.</p>
				<h5>The 65+ population is projected to increase by 30% over the next decade.</h5>

			<div class="four columns" style="margin-top: 2%">
				<p>Greenfield’s population includes a much higher proportion of seniors than the state overall. More specifically, Greenfield has much higher rates of 1-person senior households, including nearly 4 times the rate of renters. Many households in this group might be interested in alternative housing options more tailored to a single seniors’ needs, incomes, and lifestyle preferences. The broader Greenfield region has substantially more small senior households living in larger units than the state average. Many households in this group might be interested in downsizing to smaller units in more walkable locations near amenities, services, and transit.

				<h3>Middle-income households have limited housing options in Greenfield.</h3>
				<p>The following analysis examines household characteristics and housing need in terms of household incomes relative to the local Area Median Income (AMI). For example, households within the "60-80%" group earn between 60% and 80% of the HUD-established AMI for the metro area. Each household AMI group has a different need for monthly housing costs.</p>

				<p>These households typically represent a community’s “middle class” workforce, including public safety officers, skilled nurses, educators, and municipal employees. Greenfield’s low proportion of 80-120% AMI households is likely a result of limited available housing options at price points this group can afford, requiring they live elsewhere.</p>
